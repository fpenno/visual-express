# Dynamic Handlers

Files *MUST* have the same name of the export function.
dynamic/handlers.json is generated by job-handlers-minify.js + job-handlers-create.js

Add the below *dynamic* key to your scripts in package.json to then execute as *npm run dynamic*

```
"scripts": {
  "dynamic": "./dynamic/job-handlers-publish.sh"
}
```

If you decide to use dynamic handlers, do NOT include the custom handlers used to generate the JSON to avoid conflicts. One will override the other and results can be unpredictable.

Otherwise, if dynamic functions are not required, S3 can be disabled in the configuration file,
and custom handlers must be included in the deployment package.

Default configuration file for the job-handlers-publish.sh script is *vxpress*.
Modify the script providing a different configuration file name as parameter.
